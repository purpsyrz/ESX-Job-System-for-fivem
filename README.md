-> Installation Guide:
Drag and drop the "esx_job_system" file to your server resources

Add the Job Script to server.cfg:

Open your server.cfg file located in the root directory of your server.

Add the following line to ensure your job script is started with the server:
start esx_job_system

-> Troubleshooting
Check Console for Errors: If something isnt working, check the server and client console for any error messages. This can help identify issues with the script or configuration.

Verify ESX Integration: Ensure that your ESX version is compatible with the job system script and that all ESX components are correctly set up.

Update ESX: Make sure your ESX framework is up to date. Some functionalities may depend on specific versions of ESX.
